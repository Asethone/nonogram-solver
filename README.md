# Nonogram solver

## Intro
Naive implementation of nonogram solver for Nonograms Katana application in C++.

> [!note]
> It doesn't actually "solve" a nonogram, it rather fills the canvas with the predefined answer (which you can see by "show answer" button).
> Due to the overall complexity of the nonogram solving algorithm, the actual solver functionality may be implemented later in C++.

## How it works

## Project dependencies

- CMake
- ADB
- OpenCV
